## A Nascent Vocabulary 

The emergent vocabulary created for our CON assignments  utilizes the collaborative tagging of a folksonomy, in which "tags are 'flat', lacking a predefined taxonomic structure, and their use relies on [...] common conceptual and linguistic understanding within the community" (Goh, 75). Our class readings, discussions, and meetings helped us to form a sense of community that allowed us to create this shared vocabulary. 

At the same time, each student in this class comes from a slightly different background, which shapes our understanding of the words we use and the tags we create. Michael K. Buckland notes that "each community has at least slightly different linguistic practices, [so] no one index will be ideal for everyone." Our vocabulary does not account for all our differences in perspective, and as a result, our folksonomy betrays the fact that we did not design our control system as meticulously and intentionally as a larger, more widely adopted standard would have. This paper lays out the ways in which our vocabulary exhibits (or fails to exhibit) some common traits of controlled vocabularies.  

### Equivalence, hierarchy, and association 

The vocabulary we created for our CON assignments has no rules for *specific entry*, so there is no expectation that we would "[assign] the most specific term that is available in the controlled vocabulary" (Joudrey and Taylor, 494). As a result, our folksonomy has several related and equivalent terms, many of which can be modeled as hierarchical terms, in our vocabulary. For example, there are terms for "Linked data" (3 occurrences), "linked open data" (3), and "Semantic Web" (3). The third item is certainly related to the first two, which may be useful for someone using our vocabulary to know. Furthermore, "Linked data" is possibly being applied where "linked *open* data" would be more precise. If we were using a more formalized vocabulary, the relationships between these terms would be explicitly outlined, along with guidance about when each term should be used. Additionally, the use of *specific entry* as a standard would dictate that more generalized terms like "linked data" should be dropped in favor of "linked open data" where necessary.

Many of the tags used in our folksonomy are related to other tags, such as "digital collections" and "Digital Libraries." The abundance of related terms in our folksonomy seems to be common among both LIS practitioners and non-practitioners who use folksonomies. When testing how people tagged with a folksonomy,  Manzo et al. found that taggers mostly used terms related to the preferred terms. They studied both librarians and non-librarians tagging objects, and found that "a score of five (“related terms”) accounts for the largest segment of recorded tags, meaning that 50% of all of the tags entered were valid classifications not included in traditional metadata" (Manzo et al.). These related terms are still useful for folksonomic classification and description, but if we wanted to create a more controlled vocabulary, we would need to provide specifications for when to use certain related terms.

### Initialisms and other variants 

As Joudrey and Taylor note, acronyms and initialisms can complicate the creation of a controlled vocabulary, and our emergent vocabulary demonstrates this problem perfectly. Several acronyms were used without any variation, such as "IFLA LRM," but tags like "DPLA" duplicated the tag "Digital Public Library of America (DPLA)." The tags "Dublin Core" and "DCMI" also caused some possible redundancy in our tag set. It is impossible for us to know, without reading the text being tagged, if "DCMI" and "Dublin Core" are merely the spelled-out and acronym versions of each other, or if they are intended to be substantively different. Does "DCMI" reference the organization and "Dublin Core" the standard? Without policies for spelling out or abbreviating terms, it is difficult for a user to tell if these tags or substantively different or just conventionally distinct.

### Pre- and post-coordination 

The tags chosen for the various CON assignments were largely post-coordinated, in that the tags we chose did not combine the terms that related to each other on an individual object. For example, the item tagged with "Accessibility," "International," and "Medicine Archives" could easily be talking about the international accessibility of information in medicine archives, or it could be talking about international accessibility law (like the ADA) and medical archives as separate topics. We cannot determine from the tags themselves how the vocabulary terms relate to each other within the context of the tag.

While this may seem like a failing in our emergent vocabulary, some research seems to indicate that broader post-coordinated topics can help with the retrieval of information. Kat Hagedorn et al. found that single-word, post-coordinated tags generated by topic modeling were preferred by researchers when searching on results page. However, as we saw with the international/accessibility/medical archives example, this usefulness drops off on the individual record. While studying the use of these post-coordinated tags, the researchers found that "LCSH was considered superior than topics when participants reviewed item records (3/4 of the time)" (Hagedorn et al.).

## Comparing the Nascent with the Established 

Our emergent vocabulary, while flawed, resembles many existing vocabularies that have been developed at the national scale and in more local contexts. Our class has been able to create a functional vocabulary for description, but one of the main barriers to creating a fully developed controlled vocabulary is how expensive (in terms of time, resources) it is to tightly regulate a vocabulary control system. Indeed, du Preez references the fact that folksonomies are "cheaper and quicker to develop than building and maintaining a taxonomy" as a benefit of choosing folksonomies (36). Despite the fact that our class chose to utilize the "cheaper" option of folksonomy, we were still able to mimic more established controlled vocabulary systems.

### Coordinating our efforts

One of the challenges we faced with creating our emergent vocabulary was coordination. Our class meets only for two hours a day, and outside of the Canvas discussion board, there is not much space for discussing normal conventions and best practices for naming tags. Controlled vocabularies like the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) have intensive procedures for introducing new headings. The process for LCSH entails that for "each new subject-heading proposal, SACO specialists of the COOP Section verify that all the *SHM* guidelines are followed, that the appropriate variant terms are applied, and the all-important research has been conducted" (Ferris, 21).

It is possible that Zotero's autocomplete function had a hand in coordinating some of the results and smoothing out the word variances across the entire set of tags. Like other folksonomy-recommender systems, Zotero's tag recommendation "can foster the convergence to a shared tag vocabulary" (Godoy and Corbellini, 317) For example, eleven records used "Dublin Core" in title casing, and none used variant casing. Zotero's autocomplete function is obviously no substitution for actually creating procedures for controlled vocabularies, as there were many small and fixable variances in our set of tags, such as other variants in casing and pluralization across the tagset.

### Pseudo-faceting 

Our emergent vocabulary demonstrates some features of description that are used by the facets in the Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) or taxonomic scheme in Records of Early English Drama (REED). Faceted vocabulary systems group the controlled vocabulary according to some aspect of the object being described. For example, the AAT allows for the description of multiple aspects of an artistic work, such as "Agents" or "Objects," and provides lists of terms or conventions for terms in each facet. Records of Early English Drama has a vocabulary facet for "Crime and Misdemeanors."

Our vocabulary does not allow for faceting in this specific way, but we have the foundation to incorporate this sort of faceting into our vocabulary. For example, the most consistently marked terms ("Metadata Application Profile" and "Subjects") could easily be made a part of an "Major Assignment" facet, and "CON1", etc could be a part of a "Minor Assignments" facet. Additionally, we could consider the tags with our names to be a part of the "Tag Creator" facet. With our name tags marked up consistently, we can easily differentiate these from the more topical tags.

## Conclusions 

While our folksonomy could in many ways be considered a shibboleth for our own disciplinary and educational backgrounds, the shared vocabulary we created for the CON assignments is a firm foundation for us to build more formalized and controlled vocabularies.
